# Vivinner Wine Analysis Project

## Description

This project is aimed at scraping wine data from [Vivino](https://www.vivino.com/) using their web API, analyzing wines that are from Australia and Austria and above rating 3.8. The analysis will compare the mean price of wines from both countries to determine if Australian wines are truly fancier and more posh than wines from Austria.

## Requirements

-   Python 3
-   requests package
-   pandas package

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/wine-analysis.git`
2.  Install the required packages: `pip install requests pandas`

## Usage

1.  Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory: `cd wine-analysis`
2.  Run the script: `python wine_analysis.py`
3.  Wait for the script to finish running, which might take a few minutes, depending on the number of wines to be scraped and analyzed.
4.  After the script finishes, the results will be displayed on the console, including the mean price of wines from Australia and Austria, as well as some statistical information about the data.
